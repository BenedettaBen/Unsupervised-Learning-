# Unsupervised Learning 
 Anomaly detection on hypothyroidism dataset

## Overview
In this project, unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalies and cluster data are explored. The project includes:

- Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables.
- Anomaly Detection: Using Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and PCA to find outliers.
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points with DBSCAN. \\
The goal is to analyze patterns in the dataset and identify any anomalies or natural groupings.

## Methods used
1. Correlation Analysis: To understand how features relate to each other.
2. Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF): To detect outliers in the data.
3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis): To reduce data dimensionality and highlight anomalies.
4. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): To cluster data points based on density.

## Conclusions
Through these methods, the underlying structure of the data is analyzed and understood. The key patterns and anomalies are indentified.
